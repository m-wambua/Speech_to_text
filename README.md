 **Speech to text**



## This is a Python simple Speech to text code ##

** Overview **
It uses  AssemblyAI API for both the post and get requests  to get a transcription of an audio message.
you will need your own personal  authenticator that is readily available using the free version 
of AssemblyAI and you'll use it to input in the 'configure.py' within the "your-authentication-key".

To run the code  type 
'''python medium4.py <name-of-the-audio-file>.wav '''

## This will run the code and save a file with the transcription in a '<file-name>.txt' file format



however all audio file formats work.
